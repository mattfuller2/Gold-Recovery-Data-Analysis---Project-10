# Gold-Recovery-Data-Analysis---Project-10

### Description
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the processes involved in the recovery of gold from ore. Using a dataset that captures the characteristics of the materials at various purification stages, the goal is to understand how the concentrations of metals like Gold, Silver, and Lead change, and how this affects the overall efficiency of the gold recovery process.

### Project Structure
- **notebook.ipynb**: This notebook contains the entire analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **/datasets/**: Contains the datasets used for analysis, including training and testing sets.
- **/output/**: Stores outputs such as model predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

### Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and clean the datasets.
   - Validate recovery calculations and fill missing data.
   - Ensure consistency between training and testing datasets by analyzing feature distributions.
   
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Investigate how the concentrations of metals (Gold, Silver, Lead) change at different stages of the purification process.
   - Analyze the distribution of feed particle sizes in both training and test datasets to identify potential discrepancies.
   - Examine the total concentration of metals at various stages to determine patterns and potential influences on recovery.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Build machine learning models to predict the efficiency of gold recovery using the processed features.
   - Evaluate models using key metrics like RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE).

### Findings
- **Metal Concentrations**: Gold concentration increased through the purification stages, while Silver and Lead showed different behaviors.
- **Feed Particle Sizes**: Analysis revealed differences between training and test datasets that could impact model performance.
- **Model Performance**: Machine learning models were able to predict gold recovery with reasonable accuracy, though further tuning might improve performance.
